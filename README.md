# Behind Burn With Care Project
Why did I create this project?
To address my long time concern towards the burning of incense and joss paper in Chinese religious and ritual practice. 
Instead of challenging traditional culture, which I'm in no position to do so. I would like to share my ideas with the like minded.
It is something exotic in western society, so it would be interesting to hear some western thoughts.
