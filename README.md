# Behind the Burning With Care project.

<p>Why did I create this project.</p>
<p>To address my long time concern towards the burning of incense and joss paper in Chinese religious and ritual practice.</p>
<p>Instead of challenging traditional culture, which I'm in no position to do so. I would like to share my ideas with the like minded.</p>
<p>It is something exotic in western society, so it would be interesting to hear some western thoughts.</p>

<p>For who I create this project?</p>
  <p>Both who practice similar tradition and who do not. I'd like to hear voice from all perspective.</p>
  
<p>Any future thoughts?</p>
<p>I think this practice can continue, however, it need to be organized properly.</p>
<p>For example, limit the amount of joss paper and incence used, restrict burning area, etc.</p>

<p>Issues about this project?</p>
<p>I'm not sure in what ways this project can be interacted with maps</p>
<p>Perhaps launch an APP about finding the perfect place in your city to burn joss paper during holidays.</p>
