# Behind Burn With Care Project
Why did I create this project?
<p>To address my long time concern towards the burning of incense and joss paper in Chinese religious and ritual practice.</p>
<p>Instead of challenging traditional culture, which I'm in no position to do so. I would like to share my ideas with the like minded.</p>
<p>It is something exotic in western society, so it would be interesting to hear some western thoughts.</p>
